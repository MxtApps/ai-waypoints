# About
One json file containing waypoint presets for various maps, automatically fetched from Rigs of Rods to use with the AI.

# Contribute
If you wish to contribute, please see this guide on our [Documentation](https://docs.rigsofrods.org/gameplay/vehicle-ai/#creating-waypoint-presets). 

# Load local file
Put `waypoints.json` inside `Documents\My Games\Rigs of Rods\savegames` on Windows or `~/.rigsofrods/savegames` on Linux. Rigs of Rods will load that file instead of fetching from GitHub.
